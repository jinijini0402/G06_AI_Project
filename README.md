**LG Smart Home + AI Challenge Platform**

---

## 📌 Project Proposal

This project aims to develop an AI-driven family challenge platform that integrates real-time data from LG smart home appliances and wearable devices. The goal is to promote healthy lifestyle habits, household cooperation, and energy-saving behaviors through personalized AI coaching and gamified challenges.

Using IoT data such as workout metrics from wearables, laundry and cleaning activity from washing machines and robot vacuums, the system generates tailored missions for each family member. AI will provide morning briefings, progress feedback, and motivate users through points, badges, and achievement rewards.

Unlike traditional health or task apps, this platform ensures data authenticity by relying on real appliance logs rather than manual input. Families can participate in collaborative or competitive challenges, such as “3,000 Steps Relay” or “Eco-friendly Laundry Day,” fostering engagement and accountability.

The prototype will demonstrate data processing, AI-based recommendation logic, and interactive dashboard features. This project showcases the practical application of AI/ML in everyday life, combining wellness, behavior change, and smart home innovation.
