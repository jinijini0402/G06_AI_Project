**LG Smart Home + AI Challenge Platform**

## üìå Project Proposal

This study proposes a family-centered smart home service that transforms everyday appliance and wearable data into shared motivation and emotional connection.

The system aggregates data from LG ThinQ devices, analyzes behavior patterns, and generates daily or weekly AI briefings that present both family progress and personal achievements.

Through the Family Challenge System, members receive action-based goals in areas such as household chores, energy saving, and wellness.

Upon achieving these goals, individual points are accumulated, and each ongoing family challenge is visualized through a character interface.

Members can earn cumulative points by completing challenges and view family rankings based on their performance.
This process turns raw data into a game-like and visually engaging experience that fosters participation and achievement within the household, extending smart homes beyond efficiency to become a data-driven yet emotionally meaningful space for family connection.
